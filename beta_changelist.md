HackED Beta 2020:
Home Page:

- [x] Date change to from Nov 7th-8th to November 13th-14th
- [x] Could you also hide the registration buttons under the date for now and replace them with something like 'Registration opening soon'?
- [ ] Also could you add a bit of space between the 'Bring it!' title and the text in it's section? I love the way the 'All online' title fits in it's section,
      though I don't know if the 'Bring it!' needs quite as much space after
- [ ] Also would it be possible to add a bit of space between the last point in each of the 'FAQ' sections and the next header? For example between
      the last point in 'General' and the header for 'Logistics'
- [ ] I think the 'Schedule' and 'Sponsors' tabs could probably be hidden for now, unless you have any cool ideas for how we could modify them
- [ ] Then assuming we do hide those two sections, could we change the 'SPONSOR A SPECIAL WEEKEND' header to 'SPONSOR US', and make it
      look just like the previous 'All online' and 'FAQ' headings? Just in case any potential sponsors come looking ðŸ˜„
- [ ] Then we'll also need to change the year for how the website appears in google to 2021

I love the tabs navigation at the top. Do you think you could remove the 'Presentation Schedule' tab? It looks like it might be a duplicate of 'Schedule' from whoever was working on it last year.

We should probably also hide the 'Schedule' and 'Sponsors' tab until we have those ready. Would it also be possible to add a temporary 'Sponsor Us' tab that leads to that Sponsor Us section?

Otherwise the site all looks really great.

HackED 2021
Home Page:

- [ ] Could you change the tagline to "One of Alberta's Largest Student Run Hackathons"
- [ ] Same deal with the date, could you change it to January 15th-16th
- [ ] Same deal for the buttons, could we replace them with some "Registration opens soon!" text
- [ ] Same recommendations for the sections: more space after 'Bring it!", space after the last points in each 'FAQ' section, hiding the Schedule,
      Register, and Sponsors tabs (also maybe changing the color to black on the 'Sponsorship' header when it comes time to put it back in) and
      then changing the 'Sponsor a special weekend' title to 'Sponsor Us' and aligning it with the other sections, would all be incredible
- [ ] I really love the idea of the embedded Eventbrite widget in the HackED website, do you think you could look into how much work that would
      be to add to the Beta site too?
- [ ] Also could you add some space above the FAQ title? If you could make it look like the one on beta then that would be perfect
- [ ] Also could you remove the 'Presentation Schedule' tab again too? It looks like it doesn't actually link to anything on the page. I wonder if that
      used to point to something unique on a previous website version
- [ ] And could you do the same thing as Beta again by hiding the 'Sponsors' tab and add a temporary 'Sponsor Us' tab?
- [ ] Then once again we'll need to change the year for how the website appears in google to 2022
